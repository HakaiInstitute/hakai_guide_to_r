["introduction.html", "1 Introduction 1.1 Acknowledgements", " 1 Introduction The objective of this guide is to serve as a: Reference guide for the new R Analyst; best-practice guidelines for Hakai staff to make reproducible analyses, and use literate programming methods in R-Studio; and a guide to enhance collaborative capacities for ecological analyses within and between Hakai research programs and generally the science community using Git and GitHub. The beginning of this guide may seem difficult, but in making this guide Iâ€™ve kept long-term goals in mind and in a sense I have front-loaded the R learning experience with important concepts that will serve you in the near future and the long-run. 1.1 Acknowledgements Much of this document simply refers you to material that others have worked very hard to make. I simply point to these resources in an order that makes sense and seems systematic to me. Many thanks to the following people for making this possible: Dr. Jenny Bryan, UBC Professor in the Masters of Data Science Program. Twitter, GitHUB. Dr. Roger Peng, Professor of Biostatistics at Johns Hopkins University. Website, GitHUB. Dr. Hadley Wickham, Chief Scientists at R-Studio. Website, Twitter, GitHUB. Oh and thanks to Tupac and Biggie for inspiring me to write this guide. "]
