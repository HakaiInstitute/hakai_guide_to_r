Our ability to gain insight from our long-term ecological data sets is limited only by our capacity to integrate, and digest data. To that end, this guide was developed to serve as a foundation from which to build the internal technical capacity — using a coherent and systematic approach — to turn data into insight, understanding, and ultimately knowledge about the ecosystems we study. Through this guide you can learn data management skills, R programming basics, project workflow and organization, reproducible research techniques, and collaborative analysis development in an open-science context. These skills are learned through R and R-Studio, granted the skills and principles are relevant to many programming languages or analysis softwares available. "]
