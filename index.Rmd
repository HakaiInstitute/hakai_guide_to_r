This is the Hakai Institute's Data Analyst Guide. One of Hakai's core themes that cross-cuts each [research axis]('https://www.hakai.org/research') is 'Big-Data and Modelling'. Our ability to gain insight from our long-term ecological data sets is limited only by our capacity to integrate, and digest data. To that end, this guide was developed to serve as a foundation from which to build the internal technical capacity — using a coherent and systematic approach — to turn data into insight, understanding, and ultimately knowledge about the ecosystems we study.

This book will teach you how to develop analyses in the R programming language. You'll learn the basics, project workflow and organization, literate programming style, reproducible research techniques, and collaborative analysis development in an open-science context. 

The Hakai Institute is a research organization based on the coast of
British Columbia, Canada. See the [Hakai Institute Website](http://www.hakai.org) for more information.
