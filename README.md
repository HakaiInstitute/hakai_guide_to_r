# Data Analyst Guide

This is the living version of a guide for new R users and Data Analysis. The idea is to provide a learning experience for new R users and for analysts working at Hakai so we're using similar methods. There are seperate chapters for each topic indicated by the numeric prefixes of the .Rmd files above... ie. '01-intro.Rmd'. Please open up these chapters and have a read. 

Questions or discussion about the learning objectives in this guide should take place in the 'issues' tab near the top of this repository. To start a new thread, create a new issue. Tag your peers or myself like this, @Br-Johnson, to get their attention. Don't be shy. You are helping many others by asking questions where they will be recorded for future learners :)
