# Data Analyst Guide

This is the development version of a guide for new R users and Data Analysis. The idea is to provide a learning experience for new R users and to get data analysts working at Hakai Institute using similar methods. There are seperate chapters for each topic indicated by the numeric prefixes of the .Rmd files above... ie. '01-intro.Rmd'. Please open up these chapters and have a read.
