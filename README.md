# Hakai Data Analyst Guide

This is the living version of a guide for Hakai Data Analysis. There are seperate chapters for each topic indicated by the numeric prefixes of the .Rmd files above... ie. '01-intro.Rmd'. Please open up these chapters and have a read. 

Questions or discussion about the learning objectives in this guide should take place in the 'issues' tab of this repository. To start a new thread, create a new issue. Tag your peers or myself like this, @Br-Johnson, to get their attention. Don't be shy. You are helping many others by asking questions where they will be recorded for future learners :)
