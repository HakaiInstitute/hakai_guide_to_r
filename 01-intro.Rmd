# Introduction

## University Gaps

Most University courses that use R are focused on teaching statistical techniques such as generalized linear models, or logistic regression — which is very important — but pay no attention to educating students on how to actually conduct an analysis from start to finish. Questions that often remain un-answered include:

* What is an efficient workflow? 
* How do I get data? 
* How do I clean and manipulate my data into a format to analyze? 
* How do I make my analysis reproducible in case I get new data or someone else wants to run my code? 
* How can I collaborate on this analysis? 
* How can I get my analysis into a format for someone to meaningfully conduct peer-review? 
* How do I maintain version-control of my analysis? 
* How do I efficiently produce a professional report or other artifact of my analysis to distribute?

This guide aims to build this gap by taking you through an example of a well-developed analysis that will form a template for conducting your own analyses while working with Hakai. You will be directed through an efficient way to learn R, and progress to modern methods of communicating results. Learning to develop analyses in R can be a very frustrating and difficult experience. Know that we have all suffered severely in this way, but that this guide will hasten you through the drudgery and frustration.
Combined with a graduate level understanding of statistics, this guide should get you to an intermediate skill level in R-Studio using a very high-level, and modern approach. 

## Reproducibility Problem

An emerging concern with modern scientific studies is the inability to reproduce study findings. As experimental and analytic methods become increasingly complex, published methods often lack the detail required to be able to reproduce the study. As data analysts, it is our responsibility to include in our analyses sufficient notation of the analysis to facilitate deep understanding of what was done to import, tidy, transform, visualize, and model your data. 

Some academic journals, such as the Journal of Bio-statistics, are taking proactive steps by adopting a [reproducibility policy](https://academic.oup.com/biostatistics/article/10/3/405/293660/Reproducible-research-and-Biostatistics#3746779) for article submissions. The journal of Nature has taken a stance on reproduce-ability and has published several articles in a special called [Challenges in Irreproducible Research](https://www.nature.com/news/reproducibility-1.17552).

## Modern Approach to Data Analysis

There is a vibrant 'open-source' community of people developing methods, packages, and workflows in the R programming world. Consequently, we have some of the most modern, flexible, and high-level methods to develop and communicate statistical analyses. 

However, as the R community iterates ideas of how the programming language works at a very base level over the last couple of decades, we are left with a litany of methods and programming syntax's. There are typically at least half a dozen ways to write a chunk of code to reach the same desired result in R. This, in part, has given R the reputation as being difficult to learn.

This guide aims to address the 'thousand and one way of doing things' problem in R by focusing on the recent development of packages that form a simple, elegant, and coherent grammar of data analysis. This collection of packages and methods is known as the 'tidy-verse', developed in large part by the Chief Scientist of R-Studio, Hadley Wickham, and has recently gained traction within enterprise and academic applications of the R language. 

The objectives of this book are to serve as a:

1) Guide to install, set-up, and become familiar with the data analysts tools; R, R-Studio, Git and Git Hub.

2) Best-practice guidelines to develop reproducible, accurate, and collaborative analyses in R-Studio.
