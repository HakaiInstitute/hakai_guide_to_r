# Introduction

The objective of this guide is to serve as a:

1) Reference guide for the new R Analysis Developer; 
2) guidelines for Hakai staff to develop reproducible, accurate, and collaborative analyses in R-Studio.

There is a vibrant 'open-source' community of people developing methods, packages, and workflows in the R programming world. Consequently, we have some of the most modern, flexible, and high-level methods to develop and communicate statistical analyses. However, as the community iterates ideas of how the programming language works at a very base level, we are left with a littany of methods and programming syntaxes. There are typically atleast half a dozen ways to write a chunk of code to reach the same desired result in R. This, in part, has given R the reputation as being difficult to learn. 

This guide aims to address the 'thousand and one way of doing things' problem in R by focussing on the recent development of packages that form a simple, elegant, and coherent grammar of data analysis. This collection of packages and methods is known as the 'tidyverse', developed in large part by the Chief Scientist of R-Studio, Hadley Wickham. 

Most Univeristy courses that use R are focussed on teaching statistical techniques such as Generalized Linear Models, or Logistic Regression, but pay no attention to educating students on how to actually conduct an analysis from start to finish. Questions that often remain un-aswered are:

* What is an efficient workflow? 
* How do I get data? 
* How do I clean data? 
* How do I make my analysis reproducible in case I get new data or someone else wants to run my code? 
* How can I collaborate on this analysis? 
* How can I get my analysis into a format for someone to meaningfully conduct peer-review? 
* How do I maintain version-control of my analysis? 
* How do I efficinetly produce a professional artifact of my analysis to distribute?

This guide points to solutions that adress these questions by providing an example of a well-developed analysis. As a new analyst you will be directed through an efficient way to learn R, and progress to modern methods of communicating resluts. Combined with a graduate level understanding of statistics, this guide should get you to an intermediate skill level in R-Studio using a very high-level, and modern approach.
